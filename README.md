# Aircnc (mobile)

Repository for Aircnc Mobile, developed during OmniStack Week #9, a free crash course by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

Built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) (client) and [Expo](https://expo.io/).

## Concept

Aircnc is an [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com)-like app for arranging and/or offering spots for developers in companies.

This application was developed thinking about opportunities and networking between developers and companies. A company can open its office for developers to schedule visits to learn about the technologies it uses and share experiences.
